## Broad data and recruitment summary

First, we want to see if we were able to obtain consent from everyone
who took the survey:

``` r
na_data %>% 
  count(consent)
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 2
    ##   consent     n
    ##   <chr>   <int>
    ## 1 no         32
    ## 2 yes      1148

Thus, we can see that there are 32 people who didn’t actually check the
“consent” box. They will need to be removed from the analysis.

We can also look, for our own purposes, of the number of responses over
the time window that the survey was open.

``` r
na_data %>% 
  count(date = lubridate::as_date(timestamp), name = "responses") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = responses)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  scale_x_date(
    breaks = scales::breaks_width(width = "2 months"), 
    labels = scales::label_date(format = "%b %Y")
  ) + 
  labs(
    title = "Number of responses to the N-A survey by date", 
    x = NULL, 
    y = "Responses (# of students per day)"
  )
```

![](na_general_report_1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

From this, we can see that recruitment tends to happen in a punctuated
fashion rather than by trickle-in over time. Each of the peaks
corresponds to pushes coordinated by our team to send the survey to
additional schools.

For a cumulative plot…

``` r
num_students <- function(date) { 
  na_data %>% 
    mutate(my_date = as_date(timestamp)) %>% 
    filter(my_date <= date) %>% 
    count() %>% 
    pull(n)
}

na_data %>% 
  transmute(
    my_date = as_date(timestamp), 
    unique_students = 
      map_int(my_date, num_students)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = my_date, y = unique_students)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  scale_x_date(
    breaks = scales::breaks_width(width = "2 months"), 
    labels = scales::label_date(format = "%b %Y")
  ) + 
  labs(
    title = "Respondent recruitment over time", 
    x = NULL, 
    y = "Number of unique students"
  )
```

![](na_general_report_1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

We can also look at our recruitment of unique schools over time:

``` r
num_schools <- function(date) { 
  na_data %>% 
    mutate(my_date = as_date(timestamp)) %>% 
    filter(my_date <= date) %>% 
    pull(school_attend) %>% 
    n_distinct()
}


na_data %>% 
  transmute(
    my_date = as_date(timestamp), 
    unique_schools = 
      map_int(my_date, num_schools)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = my_date, y = unique_schools)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  scale_x_date(
    breaks = scales::breaks_width(width = "2 months"), 
    labels = scales::label_date(format = "%b %Y")
  ) + 
  labs(
    title = "School recruitment over time", 
    x = NULL, 
    y = "Number of unique schools recruited"
  )
```

![](na_general_report_1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

Together, these plots indicate that, in general, having a survey link
passively open over time does not really lead to the steady “trickling
in” of responses over time. Rather, it seems that coordinated pushes of
survey instruments to specific schools (with wide desemination) yield
the most responses, Thus, one strategic recommendation for MSPA might be
to build its survey instrument distribution infrastructure (either
through a portal, an app that MSPA members can have on their phones, or
some other architecture that leverages our campus network).

## Wrangling

I’ve already done some data cleaning in previous scripts, but there are
still a few tweaks that we probably want to make so that everything is
human-readable and so that only useful information is carried forward.

First, we want to remove people who did not consent to the survey, since
we can’t use their information anyway.

``` r
na_data <- 
  na_data %>% 
  filter(consent == "yes")
```

And then we can filter out some variables that we don’t need.

``` r
na_data <- 
  na_data %>% 
  select(-survey_id, -consent, -complete)
```

And create a few variables that we’ll need later:

``` r
na_data <- 
  na_data %>% 
  mutate(
    sex = 
      case_when(
        sab_is_male == "yes"   ~ "male", 
        sab_is_female == "yes" ~ "female", 
        TRUE                   ~ NA_character_
      )
  ) %>% 
  left_join(metadata, by = c("school_attend" = "name"))
```

## Univariate Demographics report

The first section of the survey asked questions about respondents’
demographic identifiers, including the following:

  - What school they attend
  - What year of medical school they’re in
  - Whether or not they identify as LGBTQ+
  - What sex they were assigned at birth
  - What their current gender identity is
  - What they current sexual orientation is
  - Their race/ethnicity

Below, we report the breakdown of our survey respondents by each of
these demographics.

### What school do you attend?

Schools are arranged in order of decreasing number of responses.

``` r
na_data %>%
  count(school_attend, name = "Number of responses") %>% 
  mutate(
    `Percentage of total responses` = 
      ((`Number of responses` / sum(`Number of responses`)) * 100) %>% 
      round(digits = 1)
  ) %>% 
  rename(School = school_attend) %>% 
  arrange(desc(`Number of responses`)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

```

![](na_general_report_1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)<!-- -->

So we can see that most of the respondents are white, a group that
accounts for about 2/3 of the total responses. There are a smaller
percentage of Asian, Hispanic, and Black respondents, with Native,
Pacific Islander, and “Other” groups corresponding to around 1% of the
responses, each.

### Program type

With merged data about the school that each student attends, we can also
compare the number of MD and the number of DO students who responded to
the survey:

``` r
n <- 
  na_data %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Degree)) %>% 
  count() %>%
  pull(n)

na_data %>% 
  drop_na(Degree) %>% 
  count(Degree, name = "Number of respondents") %>% 
  mutate(
    Degree = fct_reorder(Degree, desc(`Number of respondents`)), 
    percentage = (`Number of respondents` / sum(`Number of respondents`)) * 100
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Degree, y = `Number of respondents`)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  geom_text(
    aes(
      y = `Number of respondents` + 20, 
      label = str_c(percentage %>% round(digits = 1), "%")
    )
  ) + 
  labs(
    title = "Number of responses from MD- and DO-granting programs", 
    x = NULL, 
    caption = str_glue("N = {n}")
  )
```

![](na_general_report_1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)<!-- -->

Thus, we can see that the number of DO student responses is relatively
small relative to the number of MD students.

We can appreciate this sligtly better with a waffle visualization:

``` r
ns <- 
  na_data %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Degree)) %>% 
  count(Degree)
n_md <- ns$n[[2]]
n_do <- ns$n[[1]]

na_data %>% 
  drop_na(Degree) %>% 
  count(Degree) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fill = Degree, values = n)) + 
  geom_waffle(color = "white", n_rows = 21, size = 0.25, make_proportional = FALSE) + 
  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    labels = function(x) x * 21, 
    expand = c(0, 0)
  ) +
  ggthemes::scale_fill_tableau(
    name = NULL, 
    labels = 
      c(
        str_glue("DO ({n_do})"), 
        str_glue("MD ({n_md})")
      ),
    palette = "Tableau 10"
  ) +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    strip.text = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0), 
    panel.grid = element_blank(), 
    axis.ticks.x = element_line(), 
    legend.position = "bottom"
  ) + 
  labs(
    subtitle = "What degree does your program confer?",
    x = "Number of students"
  )
```

![](na_general_report_1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)<!-- -->

## Number of unique medical schools

According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, there are
[153 accredited MD-granting programs in the United
States](https://www.aamc.org/data-reports/students-residents/interactive-data/2019-facts-applicants-and-matriculants-data);
likewise, the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine
(AACOM) [accredits 36 DO-granting
programs](https://www.aacom.org/become-a-doctor/u-s-colleges-of-osteopathic-medicine)
in the United States.

So, we can compute the number of unique MD and unique DO schools (as
well as their percentage of the national numbers).

``` r
totals <- tibble(Degree = c("DO", "MD"), total = c(total_do, total_md))

na_data %>% 
  select(school_attend, Degree) %>%
  drop_na() %>% 
  distinct() %>%
  count(Degree) %>% 
  left_join(totals, by = "Degree") %>% 
  mutate(proportion = n / total) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| Degree |   n | total | proportion |
| :----- | --: | ----: | ---------: |
| DO     |  18 |    36 |  0.5000000 |
| MD     | 100 |   153 |  0.6535948 |

So, we can see that we have 100 MD schools (65% of total schools), and
18 DO schools (50% of total).

However, we remember from our response plots above that most of the
schools from which we have responses only have a few (\<5) students who
responded…this is a problem we will either have to solve or something
that we will have to wordsmith around.

## Do medical students think MSPA is a good idea?

In the second section of the needs-assessment survey, we asked questions
about intercollegiate LGBTQ+ affinity group engagement and whether or
not students felt that a national LGBTQ+ affinity organization would
enhance their school’s LGBTQ+ diversity/inclusion climate.

Here’s a generally useful function for plotting likert scale data that
we’ll use throughout this section:

``` r
## description: plots a stacked bar plot between LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ individuals when the likert scale is 
##              encoded by the variable my_var. Will provide the plot with the title `title` and the caption 
##              N = `n`. 
likert_plot <- function(my_var = NULL, title = NULL, n = NULL) { 
  na_data %>% 
    drop_na({{my_var}}, is_lgbtq) %>% 
    group_by(is_lgbtq, {{my_var}}) %>% 
    summarize(number = n()) %>% 
    mutate(proportion = number / sum(number)) %>% 
    ggplot(
      aes(
        x = is_lgbtq, 
        y = proportion, 
        fill = factor({{my_var}}, levels = as.character(5:1))
      )
    ) + 
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, color = "black") + 
    geom_col() + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent(accuracy = 1)) + 
    scale_fill_brewer(
      labels = rev(likert_labels), 
      type = "div",
      palette = "RdYlGn", 
      aesthetics = "fill", 
      direction = -1, 
      guide = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)
    ) + 
    coord_flip() + 
    theme(
      legend.title = element_text(size = 9),
      aspect.ratio = 0.4, 
      legend.position = "bottom"
    ) +  
    labs(
      subtitle = title,
      x = NULL,
      y = "Percentage of respondents", 
      fill = NULL,
      caption = str_glue("N = {n}")
    )
}
```

### Intercollegiate engagement of LGBTQ+ affinity organizations

**By individual - each person is a point**

``` r
#agree
n <- 
  na_data %>% 
  drop_na(interaction_agree, is_lgbtq) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  pull(n)

likert_plot(
  my_var = interaction_agree, 
  title = 
    "\"The LGBTQ+ community at my school interacts with the LGBTQ+ community at other institutions\"",
  n = n
)
```

![](na_general_report_1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
#satisfied
n <- 
  na_data %>% 
  drop_na(interaction_satisfaction, is_lgbtq) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  pull(n)

likert_plot(
  my_var = interaction_satisfaction, 
  title = 
    "\"I am satisfied with the degree to which the LGBTQ+ community at my school interacts with the\nLGBTQ+ community at other institutions\"",
  n = n
)
```

![](na_general_report_1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-22-2.png)<!-- -->

In the above plots, note that we put a black reference line at 50% in
order to indicate that the majority of LGBTQ-identifying medical
students both disagree with the statement that their local LGBTQ+
affinity organization interacts with the larger LGBTQ+ community *and*
that they are not satisfied with the level of intercollegiate
interaction that they do have.

**By school - each school is a point**

If we take each unique school and average the likert scale ratings, we
can make box-and-whisker plots to summarize the data in a slightly
different way.

``` r
var_labels <- 
  setNames(
    object = , 
      c(
        "\"The LGBTQ+ community at my school interacts with the LGBTQ+ community at other institutions\"" %>% 
          str_wrap(width = 50), 
        "\"I am satisfied with the degree to which the LGBTQ+ community at my school interacts with the LGBTQ+ community at other institutions\"" %>% 
          str_wrap(width = 50)
      ), 
    nm = c("agree", "satisfaction")
  )

na_data %>% 
  drop_na(Degree, is_lgbtq) %>% 
  group_by(school_attend, is_lgbtq) %>% 
  summarize_at(
    vars(starts_with("interaction_")), 
    mean, 
    na.rm = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("interaction_"), 
    names_to = "variable", 
    values_to = "value", 
    names_prefix = "interaction_"
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = is_lgbtq, y = value, fill = is_lgbtq)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.4, stroke = 0, color = "black") + 
  facet_wrap(vars(variable), labeller = labeller(variable = var_labels)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(minor_breaks = NULL) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(mspa_hex, "gray60")) + 
  coord_fixed(1.8) + 
  labs(
    subtitle = "", 
    x = NULL, 
    y = "Mean likert score across all respondents (1-5)", 
    fill = NULL
  )
```

### Perceived benefit from a national LGBTQ+ affinity organization for medical students

**Personal Benefit**

On an individual level…

``` r
n <- 
  na_data %>% 
  drop_na(is_lgbtq, personal_benefit_mspa) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  pull(n)

likert_plot(
  my_var = personal_benefit_mspa, 
  title = "I would personally benefit from a national LGBTQ+ affinity organization", 
  n = n
)
```

![](na_general_report_1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png)<!-- -->

So, it’s clear that the majority of LGBTQ+-identifying students feel
that they would personally benefit from the existence of an organization
like MSPA, with nearly 50% strongly agreeing with this statement. By
contrast, most non-LGBTQ+ students didn’t feel that they would
necessarily benefit from such an organization personally.

**Community benefit:**

On an individual level…

``` r
n <- 
  na_data %>% 
  drop_na(is_lgbtq, community_benefit_mspa) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  pull(n)

likert_plot(
  my_var = community_benefit_mspa, 
  title = 
    "My community would  benefit from a national LGBTQ+ affinity organization", 
  n = n
)
```

![](na_general_report_1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png)<!-- -->

Here, we see that over 50% of all LGBTQ+ students feel that the
existence of an organization such as MSPA would benefit their overall
community (even if it doesn’t benefit them personally), with over 80%
indicating some degree of agreement.

In addition, this plot shows us that most non-LGBTQ+ students **also**
agree that the existence of an organization like MSPA would benefit the
community, even if they themselves won’t necessarily benefit from the
org’s existence personally.

The plot above shows that the number 1 item that students felt would be
enhanced by an organization like MSPA existing would be LGBTQ+ health
education and curriculur design.

But we can also see that 2.3% felt that “other” activities would be
enhanced. What were those?

These data tell a slightly different story: LGBTQ+ students still think
MSPA’s greatest strength will be in enhancing LGBTQ+ medical education
and political/social advocacy, but they tend to think mentorship and
social events will be more enhanced than non-LGBTQ+ students do.

## Current-state assessment of local LGBTQ+ organizations

Our needs assessment also included several questions about what
students’ local affinity organizations were like. The variables we
measured included the following:

  - Does your school have a medical student LGBTQ+ organization of some
    kind?
  - If no, do you think this is something you would benefit from?
  - If yes, are you involved in that organization in some way? If not,
    why not?
  - Which of the following student group activies do you engage in?

### Does your school have a medical student LGBTQ+ affinity organization?

``` r
n <- 
  na_data %>% 
  drop_na(Degree, school_affinity_group_exist) %>% 
  pull(school_attend) %>% 
  n_distinct()

percentage_schools <- 
  na_data %>% 
  drop_na(Degree, school_affinity_group_exist) %>% 
  group_by(school_attend) %>% 
  count(school_affinity_group_exist) %>% 
  filter(n == max(n)) %>% 
  pull(school_affinity_group_exist) %>% 
  `==`("yes") %>% 
  mean() * 
  100
```

Thus, we can see that 90.8% of our 118 schools have a local affinity
LGBTQ+ affinity organization.

The schools that don’t are as follows:

``` r
na_data %>% 
  drop_na(Degree, school_affinity_group_exist) %>% 
  group_by(school_attend) %>% 
  count(school_affinity_group_exist) %>% 
  filter(n == max(n)) %>% 
  filter(school_affinity_group_exist == "no") %>% 
  select(school_attend) %>% 
  rename(
    `Medical schools without LGBTQ+ affinity organizations` = school_attend
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

So, for the students at these schools, do they think it’d be beneficial
to have one?

``` r
ns <- 
  na_data %>% 
  filter(school_affinity_group_exist == "no") %>% 
  count(is_lgbtq)

na_data %>%

    total = n(),
    prop = number / total

        )
  )
```

So, we can see that over 80% of LGBTQ+ students do feel that it’s
something they would benefit from, but there’s not a ton of strong
allyship going on (clearly).

Shown a different way:

``` r
na_data %>% 
  filter(school_affinity_group_exist == "no") %>% 
  group_by(is_lgbtq) %>% 
  summarize(
    yes = sum(school_affinity_group_benefit == 1, na.rm = TRUE), 
    no = sum(school_affinity_group_benefit == 2, na.rm = TRUE),
    dont_know = sum(school_affinity_group_benefit == 3, na.rm = TRUE),
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(yes, no, dont_know), 
    names_to = "response", 
    values_to = "count"
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fill = response, values = count)) + 
  geom_waffle(color = "white", n_rows = 3, size = 1, make_proportional = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~is_lgbtq, ncol = 1) + 
  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    labels = function(x) x * 3, 
    expand = c(0, 0)
  ) +
  ggthemes::scale_fill_tableau(
    name = NULL, 
    breaks = c("yes", "no", "dont_know"), 
    labels = c("Yes", "No", "Don't know")
  ) +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    strip.text = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0), 
    panel.grid = element_blank(), 
    axis.ticks.x = element_line()
  ) + 
  labs(
    subtitle = "\"Do you feel that an LGBTQ+ affinity organization is something you would benefit from?\"",
    x = "Number of students"
  )
```

![](na_general_report_1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png)<!-- -->

Visualized this way, we can see that straight people aren’t **that**
problematic: they just aren’t sure if they would be benefitted by their
school having an LGBTQ+ affinity organization.

### Student involvement in local LGBTQ+ affinity organizations

For schools that **did** have a local LGBTQ+ affinity organization, we
asked whether or students were involved.

``` r
ns <- 
  na_data %>% 
  drop_na(school_affinity_group_involved, is_lgbtq) %>% 
  count(school_affinity_group_involved, is_lgbtq)

n <- 
  ns %>% 
  count(wt = n) %>% 
  pull(n)

ns %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fill = school_affinity_group_involved, values = n)) + 
  geom_waffle(color = "white", n_rows = 10, size = 0.25, make_proportional = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~is_lgbtq, ncol = 1) + 
  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    labels = function(x) x * 10, 
    expand = c(0, 0)
  ) +
  ggthemes::scale_fill_tableau(
    name = NULL, 
    labels = c("No", "Yes")
  ) +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    strip.text = element_text(size = 11, angle = 0, hjust = 0), 
    panel.grid = element_blank(), 
    axis.ticks.x = element_line(), 
    legend.position = "top"
  ) + 
  labs(
    subtitle = "\"Are you involved in your local LGBTQ+ affinity organization (in some way)?\"",
    x = "Number of students", 
    caption = str_glue("Total N = {n}")
  )
```

So about 2/3 of LGBTQ-identifying medical students are involved in their
LGBTQ+ medical student organization, if it exists. But 1/3 of them
aren’t. So, we asked why:

``` r

      )

From this plot, we can see that the main reason students don’t engage in
organized LGBTQ+ programming at their medical schools locally is that
they don’t have time. Other reasons include that they aren’t sure how to
get involved or their interests aren’t reflected in the group’s current
activities.

Another useful insight from this plot is that the reason that most
non-LGBTQ+ students don’t participate in LGBTQ+ programming at their
medical school is that they don’t identify within the community. So,
it’s clear that there’s still a prevailing assumption that affinity
group programming might not be appealing (or have a space for) allyship
among most straight and cisgender people.

Interestingly, `Another reason` was the second most-common reason that
LGBTQ+ medical students choose not to be a part of their local LGBTQ+
organization. What are some of those reasons?

``` r
na_data %>% 
  filter(is_lgbtq == "LGBTQ+") %>%
  drop_na(why_not_involved_another_explanation) %>% 
  select(`Reason I'm not involved with my local LGBTQ+ organizatation:` = 
           why_not_involved_another_explanation) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| I don’t feel comfortable around the current leadership at my school. One individual in particular is cruel, sarcastic, and spiteful towards individuals who don’t agree with their view points. But they need the community more, so I’ve chosen to not participate in community activities they might be present at - even though I would otherwise want to participate.

| It’s all white people they don’t even know that 7 mins from our school is the only organization that serves lgbtq Latinx youth in the city. That they have their own drop in center, clinic and T program. The health issues that org is constantly dealing with in such high risk population is so so relevant to what medicine means in the real world. And they have no idea. (to be fair, the Latino medical student association doesn’t either…) People wanna be like oh how can you integrate this social medicine stuff in to the pre clinical material? What, you don’t think this can be incorporated into Endocrine? Not just psych? Repro? Where you think these kids get their gynecological care done? They Def don’t got to yr regular ol primary care with their parents. They go to places like this where they don’t have to be so scared. That’s if they get it at all. What about microbio? Uhg. I’m so frustrated. |

| The LGBTQ+ community can feel exclusive and not welcoming of new queer students at times.

### LGBTQ+ student group assessment: mission, member support, and member identification

We asked students a few big-picture questions about their school’s
LGBTQ+ affinity organization, including the following:

  - Do you feel that your school’s org has a strong mission?
  - Do you feel supported by your school’s org?
  - Do you identify with the other members of your school’s org?

Here are the results to those questions:

``` r
my_vars <- 
  c(
    "school_affinity_group_mission", 
    "school_affinity_group_supported", 
    "school_affinity_group_identify"
  )

na_data %>% 
  group_by(is_lgbtq) %>% 
  select(one_of(my_vars)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -is_lgbtq, 
    names_to = "variable", 
    values_to = "ratings", 
    names_prefix = "school_affinity_group_"
  ) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(
    ratings = 
      recode(ratings, !!! likert_labels) %>% 
      factor(levels = likert_labels)
  ) %>% 
  count(is_lgbtq, variable, ratings) %>% 
  group_by(is_lgbtq, variable) %>% 
  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x = is_lgbtq, y = proportion, fill = ratings)
  ) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, color = "black") + 
  geom_col() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(variable), ncol = 1) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent(accuracy = 1)) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(
    #have to check that this is right
    labels = rev(likert_labels), 
    type = "div",
    palette = "RdYlGn", 
    aesthetics = "fill", 
    direction = -1, 
    guide = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)
  ) + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme(
    legend.title = element_text(size = 9),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  ) +  
  labs(
    subtitle = "",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Percentage of respondents", 
    fill = NULL,
    caption = str_glue("N = {n}")
  )
```

## Outness - how “out” are LGBTQ-identifying medical students?

## How can MSPA promote intersectionality in its acitivities?

We asked students for free-text responses to the following question:

> The LGBTQ community represents a wide array of identities and
> viewpoints, particularly with regard to issues of intersectionality.
> In what ways would an intercollegiate medical student organization
> best represent all of these viewpoints in an equitable way, especially
> regarding queer and trans people of color?

and 357 of them responded. Here are the responses:

``` r
na_data %>% 
  drop_na(intersectionality) %>% 
  select(Intersectionality = intersectionality) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

We also don’t want to put too much of a burden on those members of our community that already are the most discriminated against.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The social intricacies of intersectionality are less critical in the push for generalizable education for medical students nationally                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

For example our group tries to collaborate with the Black Medical Association when hosting seminars especially since our school is in an area with large numbers of racial and ethnic minorities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| I love the phrase ‘nothing about us without us’. Make sure Q/TPOC folks are invited to the table and welcomed to participate. Encourage diverse representation. I also think it is important to specifically encourage folks who are non-binary or genderqueer/gender fluid to participate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Being concoous and active about sourcing leadership from a diverse group of students. Unferstanding that even within LGBTQ organization there is still a great deal of dissconnect between white and poc members of the group. While not as drastic of a diference I also believe you should intentionally create an equitable distribution of gender identities (including cis female).

| I am happy you asked this question. I do not participate in many LGBTQ+ events at my medical school because I am already spread thin when it comes to race issues and it is exhausting/ impossible compartmentalize my sexual orientation and race as there isn’t much talk of intersectionality. I would be the only underrepresented minority at LGBTQ+ events and I am just tired of being ‘the only’ every where I go. I think recognizing the specific violence trans people of color face is important and also understanding how race affects the healthcare experience of members of the LGBTQ+ community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| There should perhaps be a Board in place, and we should be sure that this Board is representative of people of color within the LGBTQ+ community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

I think a diverse leadership team as well as collaboration with intercollegiate URM medical student organizations would be a place to start.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Hmmm I wonder about being Catholic and queer and how the challenges involved with that can be validated without just abandoning being Catholic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| This is definitely not an easy question to answer - I think LGBTQ+ organizations and spaces generally tend to be dominated by (often white) cis gay men at the expense of other sexual and gender minorities. I think by pursuing policy and advocacy initiatives that benefit more marginalized members of the LGBTQ+ community is one way to draw more of these individuals to the organization and promote their involvement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| For someone such as myself who identifies as black, queer, and non-binary, I feel very alone within the medical field because I do not see others who look like me. Having resources or opportunities for mentorship with doctors and even other medical students at other schools who are queer/trans\* poc could help to provide more support to students with intersectional experiences. Also, providing diversity training to administration, especially the office of admissions, can help to better seek qualified, diverse applicants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| This is an important question, as we white gay men, both because of sexism that gives men power and since there are statistically more gay men than lesbians, can too easily take control of leadership and drive essentially a white gay male agenda. You could require that the top leadership group comprise one gay man, one lesbian, one bisexual person, one trans person, and so forth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| A national organization would certainly help individuals like me who lack institutional support systems. I am so heartened that there are efforts to build a national support system. Students like me are desperate for one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| I think it would be critically important to have an intercollegiate lgbtq+ medical student association. One reason for this, especially for queer and trans people of color who face multi-level discrimination at every turn, would be to develop a nationwide support/growth network. Not all medical schools are in places that are equally liberal or accepting, and so this network could provide critical support and growth opportunities for those who would benefit from connecting with a community who accepts them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| (The following does not completely pertain to this question) Being identified under several minority groups such as immigrants, non mainstream body images, gender, or certain race/ethnicity is already a stressful process. These people are often burn out with all the responsibilities falling on their shoulders as if they have to speak for what they represent, and they are often being invited to advocate, mentor, and speak at events. My concerns are how we can reduce their burden and to encourage the participation of ally who may not identify themselves in a certain category but can be a role model to normalize the way we take care of patients and we can all be supportive to each other. Another way to represent the wide array is transparency on websites or reports on the statistic/number of members and proportion of patient population who are identified as one or more ways including queer and trans people of color, to show the needs and to encourage those who are unsure to know that they’re not alone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| This would allow for people from our medical school of these identities to connect with others going through a similar education process.

I identify as an attack helicopter, but that’s never listed and we have no support, but you know, it doesn’t bother me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| The best way is to have a similar umbrella where possible, where gay students, gay students of color, trans students, trans students of color, etc, can operate but receive broader and public support from the intercollegiate organization, in my opinion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| As much as possible I think it is important to include a diverse group in the leadership of such an organization. But beyond that, it will also require proactive questioning of our peers, patients, and mentors in ways they may feel discriminated, not included, or disenfranchised in some way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| having some methods in place that ensure diversity in the leadership roles within the organization that would give queer and trans\* people of color the ability to have input in the decisions made by the organization thinking about these things ahead of time are a great way to ensure that the organization would be representative, but continuing to have opportunities once the organization is established is just as important                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| I think that it would be a great outlet for someone to be able to express themselves and have someone listen. As a person of color, I can say that the experience is very different and the main thing an organization like this could be of benefit is to really show support. It would be a way to also show the rest of the medical community that we are here. It would also connect other queer and trans people of color and I can say without a doubt that having contact or connections to people who go through similar experiences is beneficial for everyone involved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| I think there is a really important opportunity to start an organization that puts intersectional principles first from the start so that we don’t have to undo harmful structural barriers that many older medical organizations are addressing at the moment. It’s important that we advocate for the most vulnerable in our communities, and an intercollegiate medical student organization would hopefully be able to organize more national programs to promote admission of more QTPOC folks into medical school in the first place. I would also hope that such an organization could push schools and AAMC to disaggregate the data around LGBTQ students in medical schools so that we can actually see how underrepresented QTPOC folks are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| I think the best way is to involve the surrounding advocacy community as much as possible, and make sure to pay attention to the voices that often get center stage and higher representation at medical schools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Representation can refer to anything including language (gay vs. queer), visuals (rainbow flags accompanied with trans pride/bi pride/asexual pride flags), event themes, speakers and leadership with diverse backgrounds, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| I don’t particularly think that an intercollegiate medical student organization is the direct solution to representing all viewpoints because the group might not necessarily be populated/ have representatives that identify with the intersection of multiple marginalized identities. Rather, I think this larger group can make an advocacy platform that supports all other marginalized groups and also anyone who finds themselves at the intersection of these groups.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| More work needs to be done to recruit QTPOC to medical school, which could probably best be planned by MSPA working together with SNMA, LMSA, AAMC, and individual medical schools’ admissions and diversity/inclusion offices. Obviously this is easier said than done, but that’s the ‘big picture,’ if you will. So many organizations within the queer community (not just medical) can appear to be ‘white gays’ clubs’ and one of the ways to combat this perception for MSPA will be to ensure that diversity of the group’s leadership is a codified goal for the organization and strongly and repeatedly encourage QTPOC to apply for leadership positions. At the same time (this is kind of my anecdotal observation gathered in large part from Twitter), many POC have raised awareness that the labor of increasing diversity and inclusion in academic institutions frequently falls only on POC, when in fact white people, as the most frequent holders of power in these institutions, should also be working to support and expand diversity. So it also becomes important, in the queer community context, for white, cis queer people to actively fight for inclusion, elevate QTPOC voices, and hold other white, cis queers accountable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| At my institution, there is a lack of diversity and representation within the student population and within the LGBTQ+ cohort. I believe it is imperative to expand our organization and reach out to trans and people of color. We need ways to collaborate with other institutions and a platform for conversation and methods on expanding our organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Representation without inclusion and providing these students a voice and a seat at the leadership table does not rectify inequalities. Importantly, representation is not based on the school’s or even the nation’s demographics, but the local community, e.g. my institution served a population that was 50% Black, but it’s LGBTQ group only has usually one queer black student in a group of 15-20 LGBT students.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

To improve upon this, having a clear goal and implementing measures to reach that goal would be very helping in creating an environment where all medical students, regardless of who they are, can thrive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The best we can do is to be open minded and willing to listen. The priorities of an organization can never be one size fits all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| I think the best instructors on these issues are those who have experienced them. It seems very abstract for a group of people who can’t possibly fully understand these viewpoints to discuss issues of intersectionality. (Though some talking about it is better than none, even if abstract.) That being said, my school is in a pretty white area, and should we invite a speaker we will leave with one perspective. An instructive video about intersectionality from many who are living it and what allies can do would be helpful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Lack of diverse recruitment across the spectrum of LGBTQ+ identities, especially in terms of recruiting trans students and students of color, often limits representation in leadership. There should be mechanisms in place to ensure all voices are represented regardless of these biases in recruitment without tokenizing individuals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Spreading the word is nothing but beneficial and also provides for opportunities for people to hone their understanding and communication skills when it comes to dealing with LGBTQ patients and how they prefer to be treated so that we can all increase our quality of care and patient interactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| As I am not a person of color, I do not think I could adequately describe what this specific group needs. However, I think that an intercollegiate medical student organization would be largely beneficial, as there are some schools doing an excellent job for queer students and others that are not. Those schools that are lacking could better understand where areas of improvement are for their queer students that way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Not sure I understand the question, but having a larger population would mean a larger number of a minority of a minority.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Honestly I don’t even know. I’m in a class over 220 and there are like 10 black kids and 7 Latinx kids including me. I honestly don’t know. Start accepting people who are different. Who come from different places and have other forms of intelligence. Screw the mcat. That doesn’t predict how good of a doctor your gonna be. And we don’t need more doctors who are good at taking standardized tests or have that type of intelligence. We are in desperate need of diversity in the physician communtiy, we are in desperate need of people who come from complex background so that we can start really integrating all the things we are know are missing from our entire approach to medicine but don’t know how to fix (addressing ACEs and trauma, mental health care, are the most obvious ones). I really think medical schools need to let this go. You all know how unhealthy this environment is, how on average 50% of your students are depressed and have a higher risk of suicide. This environment isn’t healthy, this pressure isn’t healthy. And they you ask black and brown kids, LGBT kids, and then *black and brown LGBT kids* to just deal with it. You’re setting us up to fail. Medical schools need to some how come to terms with the fact that if you truly want to address and rectify the frightening number of suicides and rates of depression among our population, you’re going to have to start letting go and depriorotizing the aspects of your academic structure that replicates your prestige. Let it go. We’re all so unhealthy, and the more intersections of marganilizations you are the more it multiplies. And you give us nothing to hold onto, and so little space to breathe. There is no bandaid to fix all the social inequities you see replicated in medical student populations - increasing the number of lgbtq Lectures or implicit bias trainings wont work because you’re still just speaking to a majority white cis and straight population. You want to make space for people who are different, then you have to create a different space. Create special space, protected space. Medical school isn’t healthy for anyone, it’s soul crushing the more marginalized you are. Just like people assume I’m straight, people assume I go home to a stable family for Christmas break, people assume I *don’t* have a million ACEs that have predisposed me to mental illness, that I’m borderline. And I’ve been pretty lucky. For the vast majority of the queer people I know, this is the baseline of what they’ve been thru. This is normal. But it’s not normal for medical school. You think I’m gonna tell anyone here I’m borderline?\! And I’m cis and femme and not targeted or labeled as gay. What do you think you’re going to get with LGBTq students who are also poc? I’m sorry for ranting but it’s so frustrating.. Med schools know the statistics, they know the reality of what it’s like our there for these populations, poc and especially youth. They give us lectures on self care and it’s almost comical that these lectures are mandatory and the whole time I’m sitting there thinking, God I wish I could go home and sleep…. You know \#selfcare I don’t know man. I think we all know what Needs to happen. This is a systemic problem so you need systemic change. |

| Many trainings and lectures about LGBTQ+ issues tend to be isolated from conversations about racism and sexism. However, many students, including myself, do not have their experiences represented in this way. For example, my school has had lectures on LGBTQ+ health, but these primarily focus on sexually transmitted illnesses or the issues of white American LGBTQ+ people. The issues facing Black or Latinx LGBTQ+ are inherently different. I believe each school should discuss those differences especially based on the population seen at the associated hospital.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| I think providing a safe space in order to share experiences and work together to address issues for those in the LGBTQ+ community as well as allies will help not only to promote changes in individual programs but overall nationally.

| I think that representation will be crucial and, to fully recognize intersectionality, any national organization should be dedicated to allyhood with intersectional identities, recognizing the lived experiences of other identities in a way the ‘gay rights movement’ often did not. Advocacy/statements/etc. should not be solely focused on LGBTQ\*+ identity, but should also express solidarity / recognition for issues facing other groups, that may overlap. Internal representation may benefit from outreach to SNMA and/or HBCU medical schools. But, in the broadest possible terms, I think that actively soliciting feedback rather than listening for it as the organization gets off the ground will help to ensure inclusion and address any misaligned intent/impact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| I attend a medical school in the South. Currently, we have four members who are people of color, and not all of them identify as queer or trans - some are allies. An intercollegiate medical school organization would give queers and allies in our community the opportunity to expand our understanding of LGBTQ health concerns on a much broader scale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| There could be a national constitution/bylaws that schools could follow in order to make sure that all people are treated equally and that people do not feel scared or marginalized when expressing their identity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Given that certain areas in the country have more ethnic/racial diversity as well as larger populations of those who openly identify as LGBTQ+, I think it would be incredibly helpful especially for students in areas of less diversity/acceptance to benefit from a broader community experience that includes students from across the country. The more people we are able to involve, the more stories to be shared and experiences from which to learn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Focus on QPOC voices, and particularly look into and seek out the current experiences of QPOC who are in the pre-med phase of training. What are barriers there? How can we serve their needs to get them into medical school so that this group is not so wildly underrepresented? Also, find ways to honor and seek out QPOC voices without placing a disproportionate burden on them. Medical school is extremely tough, and it’s even harder to be singled out to speak for a specific group. Find ways to support students who give their time so that this knowledge sharing is a benefit to the student as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| This is an important question to ask, since erasure of intersectionality/POC is such a problem in our community (and most communities), but I don’t know if I have a good answer. I think maybe some kind of forum at a conference that would allow people (esp POC) to share their own stories (whether it be about discrimination/racism within the LGBT community or just their experiences in general) would be beneficial, although we still have to be mindful that their experiences are not everyone’s experiences. Alternatively, a name-optional publication (like a zine or newsletter) could feature people’s volunteered stories (from the mundane to extraordinary). It might garner more volunteerism if people do not feel pressured to be ‘that person’ who might be seen as a posterchild for queer/trans POC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| I think if LGBTQ+ organizations make an effort to include POC and highlight the unique struggles/stories of intersectionality, especially regarding issues with implications in medicine (violence against trans\* people, especially POC, barriers to care, barriers to transition). Collaborative events between LGBTQ+ and minority student groups can be a good avenue to bring these issues to light. Also would love more opportunities for allies to be involved at my regional campus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| By nature of small sample size medical schools are limited in representation and viewpoints. A larger group would facilitate better intersectionality and more productive conversations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| I did NOT expect this question, and I very much appreciate it\! First of all, just asking these types of questions, and recognizing the experience of LGBTQ+ people of color may be different is the first step\! First, I would encourage collaboration with national student organizations of color, which would help recruit diverse viewpoints and may also challenge these organizations to approach/appreciate/support intersectional approaches as well. Additional specific suggestions:Student support, mentorship, community, opportunities to share experiences\! Some (many?) of us are in smaller towns with not a lot diversity. All students we are paired with physician mentors for our time in medical school (mine is awesome\!) but he (straight older white male) doesn’t really understand.

| I think its a difficult positon to maintain to say ‘we want to best represnt all viewpoints in an equitable way, ESPECIALLY regarding queer and trans people of color.’ Ive never really felt apart of my local LGBT chapter because I feel like its not something my friends and I can go to and learn more about LGBT health. Despite having open doors, I feel lits more of a closed organiszation that is so aggresively pro minority that it pushes the majority away. Considering most my friends are in the majority, its not something I would bring them to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| We don’t have many LGBTQ+ people of color, or really many ethnic minorities, at my school so having an intercollegiate organization could help those who are LGBTQ+ people of color contact others who are similar to them. It’s hard going through something as difficult as med school without having mentors who are similar to you guiding you. While I personally don’t think race or sexual orientation matters in terms of mentorship, there are many people who do and so that opportunity should be made available to them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Just being present on campus and available for people to join up would be a start. I think everyone should be able to express their opinions and viewpoints, ask questions, and engage in discourse in a respectful manner. As a straight white man, I sometimes feel as though I’ll offend someone if I want to ask questions regarding sexuality or how to navigate clinical encounters with individuals with sexual preferences or identities that I’m unfamiliar with. I don’t think this should be the case, and I think that LGBTQ+ collegiate groups could do a lot of good for the community by being informative and reaching out to people with different opinions and viewpoints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| At the very least it would create a space where there would be resources. I feel like my institution doesn’t have any (or has hardly any) for our lgbtq community and a program like this could provide that for our community here                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| \- Promoting trans and POC voices in planning and leadership roles. - connecting trans and POC from different schools to each other - making an effort to include gender and race Sometimes exclusion can happen not quote overtly. Like at my school often events are labeled as ‘gay’ or the word ‘gay’ is used in meeting agendas and gender is invisible. Many times cis gay white men are the people leading things. This fact in and of itself makes marginalizing trans and POC very likely. I often don’t want to speak up because I have hurting emotions at that time and need to self-care rather than advocate and educate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| I think it would be good for people to connect with people having to deal with similar challenges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Ensure that leadership within the LGBTQ+ organization on campus includes queer/trans people of color. LGBTQ+ health education and curriculum materials should include scenarios and pictures of people of color. Mentorship opportunities should offer physician mentors who are queer/trans people of color.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Obviously diverse representation on the leadership team (however that is structured/elected). But I think it would also be important to elicit feedback from as many types of people as possible and integrating that information into objectives, initiatives and information that is given to administrators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Stop trying to speak for everyone and work towards creating a safe area and platform for all of us to speak for ourselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Be conscious of the fact that the cis/white experience is not the only experience, and that it is easier to be cis/white/male.

| I feel like part of this is just using your best judgment while the other part is making sure that all executive/advisory groups are well represented and that before any official statements or actions are made a consultation should be done with as diverse of a group as can be gathered. As long as the mission of any LGBTQ+ intercollegiate med student org includes an active investment in and pursuit of the viewpoints of a diverse body of people that does not exclude any voices, the group should thrive. As a side note, general conjecture online on the use of the asterisk in ’trans\*’ has seemed to decide to forgo it because of how unnecessary and inaccessible it is and its common application as a tool of binarism and silencing trans women.

In addition, there should be guaranteed representation of LGBTQ+ individuals of color in all decision-making circles of the organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

I think establishing substantive partnerships with organizations like SNMA/LMSA/AMWA and other identity based advocacy groups will be crucial to ensuring the success and inclusiveness of an LGBTQ+ enterprise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Any individual school only has so many students, and by definition of being minority groups, there will be relatively few members of the LGBTQ+ community and fewer who are POC. Additionally, it can be more difficult for a POC to be out in as many contexts as a white student. Having a larger organization can offer more support, and more examples of queer or trans POC in the medical field to work with or look up to, which can help begin to erase some of those disparities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| I am not a trans person or a person of color and therefore feel that this question would be best addressed by those who do identify in those groups.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Make an effort to represent as many facets of the LGBTQ+ community in the organization’s leadership on an institutional and national level (i.e. don’t put 3 cis-white-gay males in positions of leadership within the organization). Ensure that women, people of color, trans people, and the non-binary community are represented so that those voices may be heard and validated. I am the only woman of color in my Optometry school class. Our multicultural association has been led by Asian men and women for the past three years. As a result, I don’t feel heard or validated by the only organization available as a resource for my ‘blackness’.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| I can’t say for sure but would love an understanding of how different this is regionally–at medical schools in the South (and probably other places but definitely in the south), some of our classmates are religious enough that they think being queer is a sin.

| Make sure that people who are a part of marginalized communities have their voices amplified and are within all levels of the organization. Ally-ship can really only work as long as it is directly connected to the people you are supposedly working for (e.g. Don’t only have panels talking about trans POCs; have people come speak, be a part of the student body, strive for true inclusion.).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| I honestly don’t know how it would help as we need people outside of the LGBTQ+ community to accept us so that we can feel safe in more spaces to talk about how being LGBTQ+ affects our health and what we bring to the table as a health care member that identifies as LGBTQ+. But one such organization could be a place where we feel safe to talk about these subjects openly and what we can do to make it better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| A formal representation at a national stage will provide a platform that the queer and trans people of color desperately need in medical education. A strong group that is present at both allopathic and osteopathic medical schools can provide multiple outlets for discussion and provide protections. From San Francisco to Appalachia, this group could empower students across the nation to be advocates, meet others like them, and mold strong lgbtq+ student doctors of tomorrow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Maybe hosting a ‘Intersectionality in the Queer Community’ panel across schools to help highlight some of the key differences in our community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| More viewpoints, especially since queer and trans POC often don’t get the opportunity to attend med school, so a single school might not have any students of those identities whereas a larger group is more likely                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| A lot of schools don’t have LGBTQ+ groups at all. Some do but aren’t in any ‘official’ capacity. And some schools do a great job of having groups and treating them like any other student organization. I feel schools can more easily discriminate against LGBTQ+ groups because there’s no national backing so they don’t necessary have to make Pinocchio a real boy, as it were. It would also help to have research in place so schools can see that this is not a political issue but a human rights issue deserving of the same respect and privileges as anything else worth teaching. And specifically about intersectionality, all of the above comes together… just having something national in place, having the facts, and presenting information in a way that is fair and equitable to all groups. A good way to do that is to actively recruit leadership from the minorities of the minorities (meaning, LGBTQ+ is already a minority and within it, trans or POC make up an even smaller percentage).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| A lot of schools don’t have LGBTQ+ groups at all. Some do but aren’t in any ‘official’ capacity. And some schools do a great job of having groups and treating them like any other student organization. I feel schools can more easily discriminate against LGBTQ+ groups because there’s no national backing so they don’t necessary have to make Pinocchio a real boy, as it were. It would also help to have research in place so schools can see that this is not a political issue but a human rights issue deserving of the same respect and privileges as anything else worth teaching.

| By simply giving queer and trans\* POC in medicine a place to connect with each other. Our medical school is small and does not have many SGM POC. We have looked to the community for such identifying people to serve on panels and talk about the barriers they face to healthcare, but the SGM POC (and SGM women, disabled people, etc.) working within the healthcare system have their own barriers that I imagine could be difficult to get through without proper support.

I would hope that a national organization would be open to any student that identifies as being a part of the community. Regarding queer and trans people of color - these are the most marginalized groups of all, so I would hope their voices don’t get lost among those of their white classmates                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Establish an annual conference and/or regional gatherings (professional and/or social) where funding for transportation/attendance is provided for the most underrepresented queer identities. Additionally, at each of these events, host individuals from the social and professional communities that identify with these minority queer identities to speak about what they need from their allies and where/how they see an inclusive the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| I think such an organization could be beneficial, but it would not likely be more beneficial than the local groups. People of color are a special case here, as queer and trans are classically less acceptable to certain minority groups. I think the most beneficial course of action would be to develop an LGBTQ intercollegiate organization for people ‘of color’ (people of color who identify as LGBTQ etc. are a whole different thing, and should be treated as such - I don’t know why this is the case, I am speaking from my own experience). When it comes to applying to med school, LGBTQ are absolutely not disadvantaged, quite the opposite is true. But I do think these student organizations are important.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Being able to connect with other QTPOC students, residents, and attendings would be invaluable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Well, my school is located on the island of St Vincent in the Caribbean, where it is still punishable up to 5 years in prison for even *suspected* homosexual activity. That is why there is no current LGBT+ organization - because it could expose us and we could be imprisoned. So, pushing for legalization there would be the biggest hurdle to addressing all of the above at Trinity and its community at large. Because the island itself is predominantly Caribbean peoples, advocating for and achieving legality in SVG would automatically boost the viewpoints.

| This is challenging. There’s a fine-line between empowering these particular viewpoints and tokenizing them. I think the equity model would indicate that LGBT POC have the highest burden of the broader SGM community. We should shape a system with this in mind, understanding that all aspects of SGM challenges can be addressed in this space while still underscoring and engaging in outreach for POC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| For the leadership board overseeing the national organization, I think having a position dedicated to trans inclusivity and/or POC inclusivity that would ideally be filled by individuals identifying as such would ensure that they have a voice in coordinating activities and programming for the organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| I think it’s important to make sure to consider carefully the responses of trans and queer people of color, who are among the most marginalized members of the LGBTQ+ community and society as a whole. I think I tend to think solely of gay rights when considering LGBT issues because most of my LGBT friends are gay men. More visibility to smaller populations would help people like me to expand our view and reduce our biases.

| I think it’s important to make sure to consider carefully the responses of trans and queer people of color, who are among the most marginalized members of the LGBTQ+ community and society as a whole. I think I tend to think solely of gay rights when considering LGBT issues because most of my LGBT friends are gay men. More visibility to smaller populations would help people like me to expand our view and reduce our biases.

| Do not undervalue the importance of partnership. No one organization can be everything to everyone, but we can work in solidarity with others. Inevitably, any organization is only successful if it has a clear mission and a manageable set of actionable goals. This is even more true for a student organization that will have tremendous turnover. Inevitably, not every important issue can be addressed, but that does not mean that they aren’t important. Building partnerships with organizations similarly interested in health equity is a way that work can more authentically and sustainably integrate a variety of goals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| One easy way to help create a better representation would be to have all members of our community meet some of the other more marginalized groups within the LGBTQIA+ communities. For example, I think so many people don’t know a trans person let alone a trans person of color. The same goes for a queer person of color. I think the best way for us to represent these more marginalized groups is to stand with them, use our own privileges to provide them with a platform to speak up themselves. Our goal should be to help build others as we build ourselves up.

| One easy way to help create a better representation would be to have all members of our community meet some of the other more marginalized groups within the LGBTQIA+ communities. For example, I think so many people don’t know a trans person let alone a trans person of color. The same goes for a queer person of color. I think the best way for us to represent these more marginalized groups is to stand with them, use our own privileges to provide them with a platform to speak up themselves. Our goal should be to help build others as we build ourselves up.

| As a queer person of color, I have often felt excluded by other LGBTQ+ student and communities within medical school. Often, I feel that non-queer spaces are actually more exclusive to people in my position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| I think the first step is to ensure many different types of people are represented within the organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| People with multiple intersecting marginalized identities tend to have the worst health outcomes and research has been able to back this point. Focusing on the health disparities and recognizing the barriers each identity can bring to a person’s access to health care will be key to helping the most undeserved populations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| I have met very few, if any, trans medical students even when I have specifically interacted with LGBTQ+ affinity groups at different campuses. We need to have some sort of recruitment/mentorship pipeline to train more trans providers, including and especially people of color. It would be nice to have an immersion experience for younger students (late high school or early college) to help interest them in medicine and make it seem achievable for them. I know there are a few programs that recruit specifically from HBCUs but an LGBTQ+ specific pipeline (esp one that also recruited directly from institutions traditionally serving racial and ethnic minorities) would be great to see. That would probably involve a lot of funding and take time to see the payoff but I think it would yield good results. Even if you could attribute a handful of additional medical students to programs like that every year, that would make a significant difference in the physician workforce.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| For my school, LGBTQ+ representation is lacking, especially among queer and trans people of color. I feel that expanding our LGBTQ+ student association could help us integrate and understand the ideas, perspectives and needs of the LGBTQ+ community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Ensuring that LGBTQ+ individuals who are multiply marginalized have access to privacy and protection so that they are not harassed for their LGBTQ+ advocacy and social work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
